AGO is an independent organ of state and the national auditor. We play an important role in enhancing public accountability in the management and use of public funds and resources through our audits. Our independence allows us to carry out our audits without fear or favour.

We audit:</p>

government ministries and departments </p>
organs of state </p>
statutory boards </p>
government funds</p>
other public authorities and bodies administering public funds (upon their request for audit), e.g. government-owned companies </p>
We report our audit observations to:

the President, Parliament and the public through the Annual Report of the Auditor-General
management of the organisations audited through management letters
Our observations include system weaknesses, non-compliance with control procedures or legislation, and instances of excess, extravagance, or gross inefficiency leading to waste in the use of public funds and resources.
